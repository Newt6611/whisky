# sidan-csl-rs

This is a library for building off-chain code on Cardano. It is a cardano-cli like wrapper on cardano-serialization-lib (equivalent on MeshJS’s lower level APIs), supporting serious DApps’ backend on rust codebase. It has an active [F11 proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112172) for supporting the development.
